# Install

Add the CordovaCall plugin to your Cordova project

`cordova plugin add cordova-call`

# Examples

Once you install the CordovaCall plugin, it's very easy to get started. Take a look at some of these examples to get a feel for using this plugin. Note that you should place the functions in `onDeviceReady` as specified in the [Cordova docs](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/cordova/events/events.html#deviceready). The screenshots used in these examples show iOS 11 on an iPhone 7 (left) and Android Oreo on a Google Pixel (right). Because CallKit doesn't work on the simulator, you'll need to run this plugin on an actual iOS device (iOS 10 or greater). The one exception is the [`sendCall`](#sendcall) function which works on the simulator. CordovaCall works well on the Android Emulator (assuming you have Marshmallow or greater). These examples are meant to be simple, but make sure that in production you call functions within the callbacks to ensure that one finishes before you start another.

```javascript
//Vanilla JavaScript
document.addEventListener('deviceready', function() {
  console.log('cordova.plugins.CordovaCall is now available');
  var cordovaCall = cordova.plugins.CordovaCall; //not necessary, but might be more convenient
});

//jQuery-like (ex: DOM7)
$$(document).on('deviceready', function() {
  console.log('cordova.plugins.CordovaCall is now available');
  var cordovaCall = cordova.plugins.CordovaCall;
});
```

## Receive A Phone Call

```javascript
cordova.plugins.CordovaCall.receiveCall('David Marcus');
```

<img alt="CordovaCall Receive Call iOS CallKit" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26162804/31639345-435ce6d2-b2a6-11e7-8f2b-01413197f8ed.png" height="600" /> <img alt="CordovaCall Receive Call ConnectionService" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26162804/31641743-c6a7a348-b2b4-11e7-84fa-fff289754555.png" height="600" />

Once you press you Swipe up to answer on Android, you'll see the in-call UI:

<img alt="CordovaCall Answer Call Android ConnectionService" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26162804/31643304-e08ffb80-b2bd-11e7-8104-4adf85aad3d1.png" height="600" />

On iOS the native UI goes behind the app and you need to implement your own control interface.

If you're using WebRTC to make a video or audio chat app, you can call [`receiveCall`](#receivecall) right before `pc.setRemoteDescription`. For an excellent explanation of how to use WebRTC check out [this WebsiteBeaver tutorial](https://websitebeaver.com/insanely-simple-webrtc-video-chat-using-firebase-with-codepen-demo).

The first time you run this function on Android, you'll be taken to a screen that says Calling accounts. You have to click on `All calling accounts` and then click on the switch as shown below. __On Android Oreo and above this doesn't happen anymore ðŸ˜ƒ The `Calling accounts` screen gets skipped, and the native call UI is shown immediately.__

<img alt="CordovaCall All calling accounts Android ConnectionService" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26162804/31642259-09c13ce0-b2b8-11e7-98c4-b82030eb7782.png" height="600" /> <img alt="CordovaCall Accept Phone Account Android ConnectionService" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26162804/31642260-09d144dc-b2b8-11e7-8e6e-e806f4abad21.png" height="600" />

## Send A Phone Call

```javascript
cordova.plugins.CordovaCall.sendCall('Daniel Marcus');

//simulate your friend answering the call 5 seconds after you call
setTimeout(function(){
  cordova.plugins.CordovaCall.connectCall();
}, 5000);
```

You'll see a screen that shows that your call is being connected as show below:

<img alt="CordovaCall Send Call iOS CallKit" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26162804/31643420-7fbd87ea-b2be-11e7-9555-115a5e588c19.png" height="600" /> <img alt="CordovaCall Send Call Android ConnectionService" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26162804/31643429-8a985c80-b2be-11e7-99fc-6412abda3062.png" height="600" />

After 5 seconds pass, you'll notice that the screen changes because of the [`connectCall`](#connectcall) function:

<img alt="CordovaCall Connect Call iOS CallKit" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26162804/31801720-114b589e-b518-11e7-8510-4c978548e30d.png" height="600" /> <img alt="CordovaCall Connect Call Android ConnectionService" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26162804/31644024-c54ff312-b2c1-11e7-9410-c584e121bbdc.png" height="600" />

If you're using WebRTC, you might call `pc.createOffer` in the success callback of [`sendCall`](#sendcall). The best place to call [`connectCall`](#connectcall) is in `pc.onaddstream`.

## Make A Call From Recents

```javascript
cordova.plugins.CordovaCall.setIncludeInRecents(true);
cordova.plugins.CordovaCall.receiveCall('David Marcus',21);

cordova.plugins.CordovaCall.on('sendCall',function(info){
  //info now contains the user id of the person you're trying to call
  setTimeout(function(){
    cordova.plugins.CordovaCall.connectCall();
  }, 5000);
});
```

This only works on iOS 11, and not with Android. It's a really neat feature, so props to Apple for adding this. If you call [`setIncludeInRecents`](#setIncludeInRecents), and pass in true as the parameter, calls get stored in Recents. By default calls do not get stored in Recents. Once you tap on the info icon to the right of David Marcus, you'll see the screen on the right. You can set the Social profile to whatever you like (user id is a good choice for many apps that store user ids and names in a database). If you don't set the Social profile, it gets set to the person's name by default. The coolest part about this is that you can call the person back just like a regular phone call. If you use the code in this example, info will contain the user id (21 in this example). This way you can link user ids to names.

<img alt="CordovaCall IncludeInRecents iOS CallKit" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26162804/31695480-e2ff9b08-b378-11e7-9f47-f82c591b1562.png" height="600" /> <img alt="CordovaCall IncludeInRecents Social Profile iOS CallKit" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26162804/31695584-8a4cc494-b379-11e7-8492-51c6c8de0f50.png" height="600" />

## Use A Title Different Than App Name

```javascript
cordova.plugins.CordovaCall.setAppName('New App Name');
cordova.plugins.CordovaCall.receiveCall('David Marcus');
```

<img alt="CordovaCall Change App Name iOS CallKit" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26162804/31695933-905e5814-b37b-11e7-8a46-e75696b5598f.png" height="600" /> <img alt="CordovaCall Change App Name Android ConnectionService" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26162804/31696261-0ce90d5a-b37e-11e7-8b15-199dccd7e755.png" height="600" />

Say you name your app something. It will show up as the title by default with CordovaCall. If you'd like to change the text that shows up without renaming your app, this is an easy way to accomplish that. As you can see above, the app name hasn't changed, but the title that shows up has. Note that after you use this function, Android will force you to go through the Calling accounts screen again before you can receive and send phone calls.

## Use Your Custom Logo

Start by adding your icon to your app directory (the same location for `config.xml`, `www`, and `plugins`). You should select a 120px x 120px image. It should have transparency. This example uses a beaver icon found on [Icons8](https://icons8.com/).

Next you need to add resource-file tags to your `config.xml` (substitute beaver with whatever you named your image). There will already be two platform tags (one for android and one for ios), so just insert the resource-file tags in the platform tags as show here:
```xml
<platform name="android">
    <resource-file src="beaver.png" target="res/drawable/beaver.png" />
</platform>
<platform name="ios">
    <resource-file src="beaver.png" />
</platform>
```

Run `cordova build ios` followed by `cordova build android`. At this point, you're ready to change the call icon and receive a phone call.

```javascript
cordova.plugins.CordovaCall.setIcon('beaver');
cordova.plugins.CordovaCall.receiveCall('David Marcus');
```

<img alt="CordovaCall Custom Icon iOS CallKit" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26162804/31696605-868d8544-b380-11e7-9612-d4f1b18234d0.png" height="600" /> <img alt="CordovaCall Custom Icon Android ConnectionService" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26162804/31696595-7a8db322-b380-11e7-8ffb-a0a14986fe9b.png" height="600" />

How awesome is that! You can use your own logo to make your VOIP app be more official.

## Make It Say Video Instead Of Audio
```javascript
cordova.plugins.CordovaCall.setVideo(true);
cordova.plugins.CordovaCall.receiveCall('David Marcus');
```
<img alt="CordovaCall Video Instead Of Audio iOS CallKit" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26162804/31696941-8a9a384c-b382-11e7-9cff-131998a92de2.png" height="600" />

This is an iOS only feature. You should use this if your app supports video chat.

## Change The Ringtone

This only works on iOS. Make sure to add a custom ringtone file to your app directory (the same location for `config.xml`, `www`, and `plugins`). The ringtone should be a `.caf` file.

```xml
<platform name="ios">
  <resource-file src="ringtone.caf" />
</platform>
```

Run `cordova build ios`. Now call the [`setRingtone`](#setRingtone) function.

```javascript
cordova.plugins.CordovaCall.setRingtone('ringtone');
cordova.plugins.CordovaCall.receiveCall('David Marcus');
```

# Common Errors

## Info.plist

If you get an error that says `The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (com.apple.CallKit.error.requesttransaction error 1.)`, open up your `.xcworkspace` file in Xcode, and modify the Info.plist file. You need to add two keys. These keys should already be in your Info.plist because they get added when you install CordovaCall, but you might have deleted them.

1. `Required background modes` with type `Array` and value `App provides Voice over IP services`.
2. `NSUserActivityTypes` with type `Array` and two items with type `String`: `INStartAudioCallIntent` and `INStartVideoCallIntent`

<img alt="Info.plist" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26162804/31591863-ceb7d3a0-b1f1-11e7-9677-c58711f8f95e.png" width="600" />

# About

Use this Cordova plugin to make your VOIP (audio and video calling) apps feel more native by having calls within your app appear like regular phone calls. You can display the incoming call screen and outgoing call screen by simply calling a JavaScript function. Ringtone sound, call icon, and several other features can be customized. This plugin takes advantage of iOS CallKit and Android ConnectionService in order to allow you to give your app users a better experience by having audio and video calls from your app appear like regular phone calls. WebRTC goes very well with this plugin.

## Built With

* [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) - Allows you to write JavaScript in order to make apps for iOS, Android, etc.
* [CallKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit) - iOS Framework that allows your app to access the native call UI
* [ConnectionService](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telecom/ConnectionService.html) - Android class that allows your app to access the native call UI
